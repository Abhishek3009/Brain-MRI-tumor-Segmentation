## 10 Deep Learning Models (Convolutional Neural Networks) for Image Segmentation on Brain MRI scans dataset

Follwing 10 convolutional neural networks were designed and trained in Tensorflow2.0 framework.
The CNNs are Image Segmentation models used for segmentation of tumor from brain MRI scans.

The Brain MRI Segmentation dataset available on kaggle (link is attached below).
